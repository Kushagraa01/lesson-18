        <h1>Section 1</h1>
        <h1>India</h1>
        India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[21] is a country in South Asia. It is the
    seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country from June 2023[22][23] and from the time of its independence
    in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on
    the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China,
    Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of
    Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and
    Indonesia.
    
    Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long
    occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only
    to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus
    river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32] By
    1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[33][34]
    Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant,
    the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the
    northern and western regions.[36] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[37] and
    Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political consolidations gave
    rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[39] Their collective era was suffused with
    wide-ranging creativity,[40] but also marked by the declining status of women,[41] and the incorporation of
    untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported
    Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]</div>

        <h1>History of India</h1>
        By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where
        they had earlier evolved.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years
        ago.[28] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and
        storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[84] These gradually
        developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which flourished during
        2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and
        Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and
        wide-ranging trade.[86]
        During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron
        Age ones.[88] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[89] were composed during this period,[90] and
        historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[88] Most
        historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent
        from the north-west
        Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves
        In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the
        north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the
        mahajanapadas.[93][94] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became
        independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[95] Buddhism, based on
        the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the
        life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[96][97][98] In an age of increasing urban
        wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[99] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions.

        <h1>Section 3</h1>
        <h1>Culture of India</h1>
        Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the
        ethno-linguistically diverse India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the Republic of India
        post-1947. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India
        by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions,
        dance, music, architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the country.
        
        Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is several
        millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization and other early cultural areas.[1][2]
        
        Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music,
        and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India, and the world. The British Raj further
        influenced Indian culture, such as through the widespread introduction of the English language, which resulted in a
        local English dialect and influences on the Indian languages.[3]

        <h1>Section 4</h1>
        <h1>Festivals of India</h1>
        It's impossible to picture India without the country's iconic festivals coming to mind. Vibrant and loud, India
        celebrates its many special occasions with gusto. Think parades featuring gods and goddesses, deafening drumming and
        firecrackers, carefree dancing in the streets, burning of demon effigies, covering people in colored powder, displays of
        military might, and millions of people all enthusiastically participating together.
        
        As overwhelming as Indian festivals may be for someone who's not used to them, they're an experience like no other!
        Being part of a festival is a must-do when visiting India, and will be a highlight of your trip.India's main festival season starts in August and extends until March, with most of the big festivals happening from
        August until late October or early November.
        
        This is partly during the southwest monsoon in India, which ends in September, so do expect rain and pack accordingly.
        Even though the weather may be wet, it won't dampen the festive spirit. The party goes on—rain, hail or shine!
        
        Something to keep in mind is that although it's not India's traditional tourist season (which runs from November to
        March), it can be a popular time for travel as people go to see their families and make the most of long weekends to get
        away. Indian school holidays also fall around Diwali. Hence, it's important to plan and book your trip well in advance.
